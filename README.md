This little project is a little DSP plugin for Nullsoft Signal Processing Studio DSP of WinAmp

Features
This plugin allow you to enhance your music as an environnemental sound without disturbing the audience.
The plugin includes 2 audio compressor and a simple reverb effect.
With a correct setting and a "monophonic device" the background music is lowered and more smooth.
Using a "stereo device", the background music is more separate than the voice speaker.

Installation
Just copy the SPS file into this folder : C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins\DSP_SPS

Usage
The first slider "Original" set the effect level of mix between spacialization and original signal.
- Less is the highest level of the spacialization.
- More will preserve the original signal

With the second slider "MonoMode", you could listen the result as an "Mono device" or a "Stereo Device".
